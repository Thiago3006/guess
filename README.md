<h1> Guess </h1>

<p>In this project I tried to apply a basic knowledge of <strong> Bootstrap, HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT </strong>, where I made the <strong> Button </strong> more responsive.</p>
<p> In the guess you have to try to guess the flavor of ice cream, when interacting with the button, an alert will be displayed informing if you got it right or not.</p>
<p> If you make a mistake the system will remind you of the help button where you will be sent to a new page with several options to choose and try. </p>

<footer> Being a simple project, I tried to show what I've been studying, I'm always looking for knowledge and improvement. I took the first step and I don't intend to stop here.
<p> Thank you!</p></footer>
